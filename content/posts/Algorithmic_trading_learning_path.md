# Algorithmic Trading Path

![alt next](/images/post/algo_trading_path/chart.png)
I've always liked trading in general and algo trading in particular since I was a kid. Now after two years of working I have enough money to try to win more in the markets. This is nothing more than my personal path to become a sucessful trader. Since it's easier to follow a path once is written down, thats what I'm doing.

I'll try to write a review of each course I take, specially the paid ones. As we are near to close this year (fuck 2020) and I started a new job some days before, my idea is to start this journey around march or so. Hoping to finish everything in a year.
